# Tic-Tac-Toe-HTML-CSS-JS-
A simple tic-tac-toe developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to get acquainted with these skills and get a hold of how projects can help in learning.

Using HTML, a basic structure of the game is created with a navbar, and <div> tags for creating containers for the grid, the game status and the reset button, along with a celebratory GIF that plays when a player wins the game.

CSS has been used to provide styling to the page. The navbar has been made distinct so as to display the basic idea and heading of the page in the navbar. The display:grid made up our main game grid, along with the reset button customization in order to beautify the page a little more. Using hover features, we have added styling so that the user sees a different color in the blocks once they hover over a box.

We've used JavaScript to provide functionality to the game. On clicking on a box, a symbol "X" or "O" is inserted after checking whether the box is empty or not. Once the user meets the win condition (3 in a row, column, diagonal) the game displays that the player has won, and the attached GIF is played. Then the players can clear the board with the reset button, to play a fresh new game. Along with it, a transitional line is also added which cuts through the matched symbols in case of a win.
